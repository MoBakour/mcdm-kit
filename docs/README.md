# MCDM Kit Documentation

Welcome to the MCDM Kit documentation! This library provides a comprehensive toolkit for Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems, offering various methods and tools to help you make informed decisions.

## Overview

MCDM Kit is a Python library that implements various Multi-Criteria Decision Making methods, including:

-   TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution)
-   WISP (Weighted Ideal Solution Point)
-   CIMAS (Comprehensive Ideal Solution Method)
-   ARTASI (Analytical Ranking Technique for Alternative Selection)
-   WENSLOW (Weighted Entropy-based Solution for Linear Ordering)
-   MABAC (Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison)
-   ARLON (Analytical Ranking with Linear Ordering)
-   DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory)

The library also supports various types of fuzzy sets for handling uncertainty in decision-making:

-   Picture Fuzzy Sets (PFS)
-   Interval Fuzzy Sets (IFS)
-   Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (T2FS)
-   Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets (INFS)
-   Spherical Fuzzy Sets (SFS)
-   Neutrosophic Sets (NFS)
-   Pythagorean Fuzzy Sets (PYFS)
-   Fermatean Fuzzy Sets (FFS)
-   Hesitant Fuzzy Sets (HFS)

## Key Features

-   Flexible decision matrix creation and manipulation
-   Support for both numerical and fuzzy data
-   Multiple MCDM methods implementation
-   Comprehensive fuzzy set operations
